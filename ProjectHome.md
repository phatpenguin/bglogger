1.1	Description
Blood Glucose Logger (bglogger) is an application to be used by people with diabetes who need to monitor their blood glucose levels several times a day.  In addition to blood glucose, the app will also log exercise, dietary information and medications.

1.2	Justification
Diabetes is a disease that requires constant monitoring and care.  Type 1 diabetics and some type 2 diabetics must monitor their blood sugars frequently and keep track of the results to maintain their health.  There are many blood sugar monitoring applications on the Android market, but most of them are commercial and do not offer the full set of features required for proper diabetic monitoring.  Blood Glucose Logger (bglogger) will provide a free application with improved user interface and features over what is available on the Android market.
